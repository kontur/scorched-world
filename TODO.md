#3D mortar game

##Top level to-do's
* generate terrain
* basic UI for player controls
* physics for shooting projectiles
* camera controls
* basic opponent AI
* target hit logic

###Improvement from crude initial implementations
* player position centerish on the map and not too close to each other
* player controls for firing projectiles
* player / AI visual distinction
* better noise based terrain generation

####Low priority cool to have
* seemingly endless terrain around the arena
* player models imported form obj files
* aiming guide vectors / trajectories
* player names / life hovering above player objects
